### Howdy ðŸ‘‹!

My name is Kevin Yu, I'm a 4th year Computer Engineering :computer: Student at Queens University. Besides being a programmer, I'm an active long-distance runner :runner:, I enjoy reading non-fiction books :books: about psychology and self improvement, and I dabble here and there into UI/UX design :art:. 

Now, I decided on Computer Engineering as a career option because I've always dreamt of building cool technology :iphone: that could impact me or someone else in their day to day lives. This ambition of mine has lead me down ventures such as working at a small startup company, competing in hackathons, developing websites, building order management systems for clients as well as working as a software engineering intern.

Recently, I just finished my internship at PWC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) working as a software engineering intern, and now I'm finishing up my senior year of university. We'll see where life takes me from here, but I'm excited for whatever life throws my way :mortar_board:!
